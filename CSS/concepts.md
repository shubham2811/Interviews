| Feature            | Flexbox                                 | Grid                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Layout Direction   | One-dimensional (row **or** column)     | Two-dimensional (rows **and** columns)|
| Main Use Case      | Aligning items in a single line or axis | Creating complex layouts with rows and columns |
| Parent/Child Roles | Parent is flex container, children are flex items | Parent is grid container, children are grid items |
| Item Placement     | Controlled along main/cross axis        | Controlled by defining grid lines, areas, and cells |
| Overlapping Items  | Not supported                           | Supported via grid lines and areas   |
| Responsiveness     | Good for simple, linear layouts         | Excellent for complex, responsive layouts |
| Browser Support    | All modern browsers                     | All modern browsers                  |

## Flexbox

- Best for distributing space and aligning items along a single axis (row or column).
- Items flow naturally in one direction.
- Useful for navigation bars, toolbars, and simple layouts.

**Example:**
```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row; /* or column */
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
}
```
## Grid

- Designed for building complex, two-dimensional layouts.
- Allows precise placement of items in rows and columns.
- Supports overlapping items and named grid areas.

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr;
  grid-template-rows: auto 100px;
  gap: 10px;
}
```
